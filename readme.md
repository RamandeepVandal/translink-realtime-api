### Real-time Transit Information Front-End Project
This is a front-end project that uses the Real-time Transit Information REST API to allow users to search for transit routes and view current bus information.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine, in the root directory run **npm i** to install all dependencies, and then run **npm run dev** to start the app. The application will be loaded and ready to use.

## Usage
Once the application is loaded, users can use the search bar at the top of the page to search for transit routes and bus availability.  

When a user selects a route, the page will display current bus information for that route. The current bus information includes the location of each bus on the route, as well as the estimated arrival time for each bus at the next stop.

Technologies Used
This project was built using React, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5, and the Real-time Transit Information REST API.
